## 🚀 About Me

I'm a Full Stack .NET Developer with two years of professional experience in **ASP.NET Core MVC** and **APIs**. At 26 years old, after exploring many different fields, I discovered my true passion: writing code. This passion led me to pursue software development as a career.

I specialize in application development—be it back-end, front-end, or full-stack—using a wide range of technologies to build responsive, clean, and maintainable applications. My focus is on delivering robust solutions for web development projects and continuously improving my skills.

Currently, I am seeking opportunities to leverage my expertise in a collaborative team environment and contribute to impactful web projects.
